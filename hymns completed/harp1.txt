Brazillian version :

1
  Deus prometeu com certeza
  Chuvas de graça mandar;
  Ele nos dá fortaleza,
  E ricas bênçãos sem par

  Refrão
      Chuvas de graça,
      Chuvas pedimos, Senhor;
      Manda-nos chuvas constantes,
      Chuvas do Consolador.



2
  Cristo nos tem concedido
  O santo Consolador,
  De plena paz nos enchido,
  Para o reinado do amor.

3
  Dá-nos, Senhor, amplamente,
  Teu grande gozo e poder;
  Fonte de amor permanente,
  Põe dentro de nosso ser.

4
  Faze os teus servos piedosos,
  Dá-lhes virtude e valor,
  Dando os teus dons preciosos,
  Do santo Preceptor.


Original version :

1
  There shall be showers of blessing:
    This is the promise of love;
  There shall be seasons refreshing,
    Sent from the Savior above.

Chorus 
  Showers of blessing,
    Showers of blessing we need;
  Mercy-drops round us are falling,
      But for the showers we plead.



2
  There shall be showers of blessing—
    Precious reviving again;
  Over the hills and the valleys,
    Sound of abundance of rain.
3
  There shall be showers of blessing;
    Send them upon us, O Lord!
  Grant to us now a refreshing;
    Come, and now honor Thy Word.
4
  There shall be showers of blessing;
    O that today they might fall,
  Now as to God we’re confessing,
    Now as on Jesus we call!
5
  There shall be showers of blessing,
    If we but trust and obey;
  There shall be seasons refreshing,
    If we let God have His way.

Changes ( *if any) :

Well the most visible change is that there is one verse that was lost in the translation process,The chorus is changed little with the orders of the pleading from the last sentence to the second sentence.
it was also removed the repetition of ``There shall be showers of blessing´´ in the translation.
